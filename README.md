# prisoners-dilemma-simulator
This Python program simulates the Prisoner's Dilemma game, allowing players to choose between different prisoner strategies (Cooperator, Defector, Revenger). The game runs for a specified number of rounds, with a brief delay between each round, and includes an option to view descriptions of each strategy before starting.
